# train-CLIP using Deep Lake ðŸ“Ž

A PyTorch Lightning solution to training CLIP from both scratch and fine-tuning using Deep Lake as the data lake. Source from https://github.com/Zasder3/train-CLIP
 
## Usage with Deep Lake ðŸš‚

Replace your Activeloop API token with the placeholder and run the following command to initiate training.

```bash
python train.py \
    --path 'hub://genai360/laion-400M' \
    --token {your_activeloop_token} \
    --model_name ViT-B/16  \
    --batch_size 64 \
    --accelerator gpu \
    --gpus 2 \
    --strategy ddp \
    --filter_NSFW \
    --fp 16
```


### From Scratch ðŸŒµ
This training setup is easily usable right outside the box! Simply provide a training directory or your own dataset and we've got the rest covered. To train a model just specify a name from the paper name and tell us your training folder and batch size. All possible models can be seen in the yaml files in `models/config`

```
python train.py --model_name RN50 --folder data_dir --batchsize 512
```

### Data-Efficient Finetuning ðŸš†
To perform CLIP training much more efficiently, you might be interested in the class `CustomCLIPWrapper`. This functions as a way to finetune pre-trained image and language models; in turn this leads to a large performance efficiency increase! In order to use this, one simply needs to modify the `train_finetune.py` file to pass an image encoder and Hugging Face text encoder. 

```python
img_encoder = resnet50(pretrained=True)
img_encoder.fc = torch.nn.Linear(2048, 768)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("johngiorgi/declutr-sci-base")
txt_encoder = AutoModel.from_pretrained("johngiorgi/declutr-sci-base")

model = CustomCLIPWrapper(img_encoder, txt_encoder, hparams.minibatch_size, avg_word_embs=True)
```

The command line argument is the same as before minus the `--model_name` flag:
```
python train.py --model_name RN50 --folder data_dir --batchsize 512
```

### Training with our DataModule ðŸ“‰

As long as each of the image pairs have the same stem name (i.e. `coco_img1.png` and `coco_img1.txt`) all that you need to do is specify the folder on runtime. Any subfolder structure will be ignored, meaning `foo/bar/image1.jpg` will always find its `myster/folder/image1.txt` so long as they share a common parent folder. All image suffixes will work, the only expectation is that captions are separated by `\n`.

### Traing with you own Data ðŸ“Š

If you have different training needs you may drop in your very own DataLoader. Edit the `train.py` script to you needs by commenting out our DataModule and inserting your own into `trainer.fit(model, your_data)`. The only expectation is that the first item of the return tuple is the image batch, and the second is the text batch.

## Goal âš½

Our aim is to create an easy to use Lightning implementation of OpenAI's clip training script. We want our end product to be as inline with the orignal paper as possible. We will live by:
